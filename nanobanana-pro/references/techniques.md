## Spatial Anchors & Layout Control

Nano Banana Pro excels with explicit spatial instructions. Use these patterns:

### Positional Anchors

```
Subject: [position relative to frame]
- "centered in frame"
- "positioned in the left third"
- "filling the right side of the composition"
- "in the foreground, slightly off-center"
```

### Depth Layers

```
Foreground: [close objects with detail]
Middle ground: [subject typically here]
Background: [environmental context]

Example:
"In the foreground, a dark luxury perfume bottle with metallic accents.
In the middle ground, she sits on the marble countertop.
In the background, a large mirror reflects the door."
```

### Camera Distance

```
- "extreme close-up on face only"
- "medium close-up, chest and head"
- "medium shot, waist up"
- "full body shot"
- "wide establishing shot showing full environment"
```

### Angle Specifications

```
- "eye-level, direct"
- "slightly low angle, looking up"
- "high angle, looking down"
- "three-quarter view"
- "profile view"
- "over-the-shoulder perspective"
```

## Lighting Mastery

### Natural Light Types

```
Golden Hour:
"warm golden-hour sunlight entering from the right,
soft highlights, gentle falloff, realistic contrast"

Overcast:
"soft diffused overcast light, even illumination,
no harsh shadows, subtle gradients"

Window Light:
"natural window light from the left, side-lit,
high contrast chiaroscuro, warm golden temperature"

Dappled:
"light filtering through leaves/blinds creating
distinct striped shadows across the subject"
```

### Artificial Light Types

```
Flash:
"hard flash photography, bright flash burst visible,
starburst flare, high contrast, hard shadows"

Practical Lights:
"warm practical light from bedside lamp,
mixed with cool moonlight from window"

Ring Light:
"even frontal lighting with catchlights in eyes,
minimal shadows, beauty lighting"
```

### Light Behavior Descriptors

```
Quality: "soft" / "hard" / "diffused" / "harsh"
Direction: "side-lit" / "back-lit" / "frontal" / "top-lit"
Temperature: "warm golden" / "cool blue" / "neutral"
Intensity: "bright" / "dim" / "blown-out highlights"
Falloff: "gentle falloff" / "rapid falloff" / "even"
```

### Shadow Patterns

```
- "venetian blind shadows across legs"
- "gobo pattern shadows on wall"
- "soft undefined shadows"
- "hard-edged shadows"
- "no visible shadows (flat lighting)"
```

## Color Story Design

### Color Harmony Patterns

```
Monochromatic:
"Various shades of blue: navy top, light blue jeans,
sky blue background"

Complementary:
"Orange and blue contrast: warm sunset skin tones
against cool blue hour sky"

Triadic:
"Red, yellow, blue accents: red lipstick, yellow top,
blue denim"

Split-complementary:
"Purple subject against yellow-green and yellow-orange
environment"
```

### Color Story Template

```json
{
  "color_story": {
    "subject_primary": "[main clothing color]",
    "subject_secondary": "[accent clothing color]",
    "subject_accents": "[accessories, makeup]",
    "skin_tones": "[warm/cool/neutral]",
    "hair_color": "[specific shade]",
    "environment_dominant": "[main background color]",
    "environment_accents": "[secondary environment colors]",
    "overall_harmony": "[describe the color relationship]",
    "mood_from_colors": "[emotional effect]"
  }
}
```

### Color Grading Terms

```
Film Stock Emulation:
- "Kodak Portra 400: warm skin tones, gentle contrast, organic"
- "Fujifilm Pro 400H: soft pastels, lifted shadows, dreamy"
- "Cinestill 800T: tungsten cast, halation, cinema look"
- "Kodak Ektar: saturated, punchy, high contrast"

Digital Presets:
- "VSCO A6: analog film, desaturated, lifted blacks"
- "Classic chrome simulation: muted, filmic"
- "Orange and teal: blockbuster movie grade"
```

## Narrative Elements

### Story Context Patterns

Add a brief narrative to ground the image in reality:

```
"She's been on the balcony for hours.
Bottle was full, now it's not.
The city kept her company.
It's late, she's tired, she's GOOD."
```

### The "Why" of the Photo

```
Narrative elements to include:
- Why is this photo being taken?
- What happened just before?
- What will happen after?
- What's the emotional state?
- Who is this for?

Example:
"This is the 'caught me with this random supercar' pose
that's definitely not random. Caption energy: '🩷'
and nothing else."
```

### Time and Context Anchors

```
- "Late Sunday morning, bright harsh sunlight"
- "Saturday night pre-party panic"
- "2am hotel hallway moment"
- "First coffee of the morning"
- "Just came in from the cold, flushed cheeks"
```

## Material & Texture Language

### Fabric Behavior

```
Satin/Silk:
"visible sheen from light, natural folds and tension,
accurate drape and gravity, catches light on curves"

Cotton:
"soft matte texture, natural wrinkles,
breathable weight, comfortable drape"

Denim:
"rigid structure, visible weave texture,
natural fading patterns, stress creases at joints"

Knit:
"cable patterns visible, soft stretch,
cozy texture, slight pilling on vintage pieces"

Leather:
"smooth grain visible, slight shine,
natural creasing at joints, worn-in patina"
```

### Fabric Physics Checklist

```
✓ How does it interact with light? (sheen, matte, reflective)
✓ How does it fold? (crisp, soft, flowing)
✓ How does it respond to body shape? (tight, loose, draped)
✓ What's its weight? (heavy, light, medium)
✓ Any wear patterns? (fading, pilling, stretching)
```

### Surface Textures

```
Skin: "visible pores, natural redness, freckles,
slight imperfections, not airbrushed"

Hair: "individual strands visible, frizzy halo,
natural texture, some flyaways"

Makeup: "dewy finish, slight shine on T-zone,
lip gloss catching light"

Environment: "dust motes in light beams, textured rug,
visible wood grain, marble veining"
```

## Expression Microdetails

### Eye Expressions

```
Energy Levels:
- "bright, alert, fully awake"
- "heavy-lidded, sleepy but present"
- "half-closed, tired but alive"
- "wide, surprised, caught off-guard"

Emotional States:
- "soft doe eyes through lowered lashes"
- "knowing look, slight invitation"
- "focused on phone screen"
- "distant, lost in thought"
- "crinkled shut from genuine laughter"
```

### Mouth/Lip Expressions

```
Positions:
- "soft part, slightly open"
- "closed, relaxed smile"
- "lips pursed, concentrated"
- "mid-laugh, mouth open"
- "subtle pout, natural resting"

Details:
- "glossy shine catching light"
- "wine-stained, darker pink"
- "chapped, natural texture"
- "lip liner visible, defined edges"
```

### Micro-Expression Combinations

```
"Tired but inviting":
eyes: heavy-lidded but still warm
mouth: soft, relaxed, slight upturn
brows: slightly lowered, relaxed
overall: "I'm tired but I'd wake up for you"

"Casual confidence":
eyes: direct gaze, slightly narrowed
