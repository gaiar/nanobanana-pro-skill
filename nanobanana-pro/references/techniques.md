## Spatial Anchors & Layout Control

Nano Banana Pro excels with explicit spatial instructions. Use these patterns:

### Positional Anchors

```
Subject: [position relative to frame]
- "centered in frame"
- "positioned in the left third"
- "filling the right side of the composition"
- "in the foreground, slightly off-center"
```

### Depth Layers

```
Foreground: [close objects with detail]
Middle ground: [subject typically here]
Background: [environmental context]

Example:
"In the foreground, a dark luxury perfume bottle with metallic accents.
In the middle ground, she sits on the marble countertop.
In the background, a large mirror reflects the door."
```

### Camera Distance

```
- "extreme close-up on face only"
- "medium close-up, chest and head"
- "medium shot, waist up"
- "full body shot"
- "wide establishing shot showing full environment"
```

### Angle Specifications

```
- "eye-level, direct"
- "slightly low angle, looking up"
- "high angle, looking down"
- "three-quarter view"
- "profile view"
- "over-the-shoulder perspective"
```

---

## Lighting Mastery

### Natural Light Types

```
Golden Hour:
"warm golden-hour sunlight entering from the right,
soft highlights, gentle falloff, realistic contrast"

Overcast:
"soft diffused overcast light, even illumination,
no harsh shadows, subtle gradients"

Window Light:
"natural window light from the left, side-lit,
high contrast chiaroscuro, warm golden temperature"

Dappled:
"light filtering through leaves/blinds creating
distinct striped shadows across the subject"
```

### Artificial Light Types

```
Flash:
"hard flash photography, bright flash burst visible,
starburst flare, high contrast, hard shadows"

Practical Lights:
"warm practical light from bedside lamp,
mixed with cool moonlight from window"

Ring Light:
"even frontal lighting with catchlights in eyes,
minimal shadows, beauty lighting"
```

### Light Behavior Descriptors

```
Quality: "soft" / "hard" / "diffused" / "harsh"
Direction: "side-lit" / "back-lit" / "frontal" / "top-lit"
Temperature: "warm golden" / "cool blue" / "neutral"
Intensity: "bright" / "dim" / "blown-out highlights"
Falloff: "gentle falloff" / "rapid falloff" / "even"
```

### Shadow Patterns

```
- "venetian blind shadows across legs"
- "gobo pattern shadows on wall"
- "soft undefined shadows"
- "hard-edged shadows"
- "no visible shadows (flat lighting)"
```

---

## Color Story Design

### Color Harmony Patterns

```
Monochromatic:
"Various shades of blue: navy top, light blue jeans,
sky blue background"

Complementary:
"Orange and blue contrast: warm sunset skin tones
against cool blue hour sky"

Triadic:
"Red, yellow, blue accents: red lipstick, yellow top,
blue denim"

Split-complementary:
"Purple subject against yellow-green and yellow-orange
environment"
```

### Color Story Template

```json
{
  "color_story": {
    "subject_primary": "[main clothing color]",
    "subject_secondary": "[accent clothing color]",
    "subject_accents": "[accessories, makeup]",
    "skin_tones": "[warm/cool/neutral]",
    "hair_color": "[specific shade]",
    "environment_dominant": "[main background color]",
    "environment_accents": "[secondary environment colors]",
    "overall_harmony": "[describe the color relationship]",
    "mood_from_colors": "[emotional effect]"
  }
}
```

### Color Grading Terms

```
Film Stock Emulation:
- "Kodak Portra 400: warm skin tones, gentle contrast, organic"
- "Fujifilm Pro 400H: soft pastels, lifted shadows, dreamy"
- "Cinestill 800T: tungsten cast, halation, cinema look"
- "Kodak Ektar: saturated, punchy, high contrast"

Digital Presets:
- "VSCO A6: analog film, desaturated, lifted blacks"
- "Classic chrome simulation: muted, filmic"
- "Orange and teal: blockbuster movie grade"
```

---

## Narrative Elements

### Story Context Patterns

Add a brief narrative to ground the image in reality:

```
"She's been on the balcony for hours.
Bottle was full, now it's not.
The city kept her company.
It's late, she's tired, she's GOOD."
```

### The "Why" of the Photo

```
Narrative elements to include:
- Why is this photo being taken?
- What happened just before?
- What will happen after?
- What's the emotional state?
- Who is this for?

Example:
"This is the 'caught me with this random supercar' pose
that's definitely not random. Caption energy: '🩷'
and nothing else."
```

### Time and Context Anchors

```
- "Late Sunday morning, bright harsh sunlight"
- "Saturday night pre-party panic"
- "2am hotel hallway moment"
- "First coffee of the morning"
- "Just came in from the cold, flushed cheeks"
```

---

## Material & Texture Language

### Fabric Behavior

```
Satin/Silk:
"visible sheen from light, natural folds and tension,
accurate drape and gravity, catches light on curves"

Cotton:
"soft matte texture, natural wrinkles,
breathable weight, comfortable drape"

Denim:
"rigid structure, visible weave texture,
natural fading patterns, stress creases at joints"

Knit:
"cable patterns visible, soft stretch,
cozy texture, slight pilling on vintage pieces"

Leather:
"smooth grain visible, slight shine,
natural creasing at joints, worn-in patina"
```

### Fabric Physics Checklist

```
✓ How does it interact with light? (sheen, matte, reflective)
✓ How does it fold? (crisp, soft, flowing)
✓ How does it respond to body shape? (tight, loose, draped)
✓ What's its weight? (heavy, light, medium)
✓ Any wear patterns? (fading, pilling, stretching)
```

### Surface Textures

```
Skin: "visible pores, natural redness, freckles,
slight imperfections, not airbrushed"

Hair: "individual strands visible, frizzy halo,
natural texture, some flyaways"

Makeup: "dewy finish, slight shine on T-zone,
lip gloss catching light"

Environment: "dust motes in light beams, textured rug,
visible wood grain, marble veining"
```

## Defeating the AI Look

AI-generated images share telltale traits: perfect symmetry, porcelain skin, oversaturated colors, and a synthetic studio sheen. Use these four principles to break through the uncanny valley.

### 1. Break Perfect Symmetry and Composition

AI defaults to centered subjects, balanced framing, and rule-of-thirds precision. Real photos are messier.

```
Composition breakers:
- "subject slightly off-center, tilted frame"
- "awkward crop cutting off part of the head or elbow"
- "background element intruding into the frame edge"
- "slightly crooked horizon, not corrected"
- "one shoulder higher than the other, natural asymmetry"
- "shot from an imperfect angle, as if the photographer shifted mid-click"

Facial asymmetry:
- "one eye slightly narrower than the other"
- "natural asymmetry in jawline and brow height"
- "uneven smile, one corner higher"
- "nose not perfectly centered, slight natural deviation"
```

Avoid: dead-center subjects, perfectly mirrored poses, textbook compositional balance.

### 2. Real Skin, Not Porcelain

AI models gravitate toward flawless, pore-free, uniformly lit skin — the "porcelain doll" effect. Push hard for biological texture.

```
Skin texture directives:
- "visible pores on nose and cheeks"
- "natural redness around nostrils and inner eye corners"
- "uneven skin tone, slight blotchiness"
- "fine peach fuzz visible on cheeks in side light"
- "tiny imperfections: a faint scar, a mole, a blemish"
- "dark circles under eyes, natural fatigue"
- "chapped lips with visible texture, not glossy-smooth"
- "sun damage, freckle clusters of varying size and density"
- "visible veins on hands, temples, or inner wrists"
- "skin reacts to environment: goosebumps, flush from cold, sweat sheen"

Explicit exclusions:
- "NOT airbrushed, NOT smoothed, NOT beauty-filtered"
- "no porcelain-doll effect, no waxy texture"
- "no uniform skin tone, no synthetic perfection"
```

### 3. Kill Saturation and Remove AI Sheen

AI images tend to be oversaturated with an artificial glow — colors too vivid, highlights too clean, everything coated in a synthetic luminosity.

```
Desaturation and color correction:
- "muted, desaturated color palette"
- "colors slightly faded as if shot on expired film"
- "subdued tones, nothing artificially vivid"
- "natural color response, no HDR boost"
- "lifted blacks, compressed dynamic range"
- "skin tones lean warm and matte, not luminous"

Anti-sheen directives:
- "no artificial glow or bloom on skin"
- "matte finish, no synthetic radiance"
- "dull highlights, not blown-out or pearlescent"
- "light falls off naturally, no global illumination feel"
- "shadows are muddy and imprecise, not clean gradients"

Film stock shortcuts (inherently desaturated):
- "Kodak Portra 400 color response" — warm, gentle, organic
- "Fujifilm Superia 400" — muted greens, understated
- "VSCO A6 processing" — analog, faded, real
- "cross-processed slide film" — shifted hues, imperfect
```

### 4. Add Grain and Analog Artifacts

The final layer: physical imperfections that no neural network adds on its own. These break the digital sterility.

```
Film grain:
- "visible film grain, especially in shadows and midtones"
- "medium grain structure consistent with ISO 400-800 film"
- "coarse grain in low-light areas"
- "grain is organic and irregular, not uniform digital noise"

Lens artifacts:
- "subtle chromatic aberration at frame edges"
- "slight lens softness in corners, sharp only at center"
- "natural vignetting, darker edges"
- "lens flare from practical light source, not added in post"
- "minor barrel distortion from wide-angle proximity"

Analog imperfections:
- "faint light leak bleeding warm color from one edge"
- "very slight motion blur on hands or hair, frozen imperfectly"
- "dust speck or hair on the negative, barely visible"
- "scanner texture if applicable"
- "slight color fringing on high-contrast edges"

Camera behavior:
- "shallow depth of field with imperfect focus transition"
- "focus slightly missed — sharp on the ear, soft on the eyes"
- "auto-white-balance slightly off, giving a color cast"
- "flash redeye partially corrected, slight residual glow"
```

### Putting It All Together

When applying these principles, layer them — don't pick just one:

```
Anti-AI checklist for every prompt:
□ Asymmetric composition or imperfect framing
□ Biological skin texture with at least 2-3 specific imperfections
□ Desaturated or muted color palette, no HDR glow
□ Film grain or at least one analog artifact
□ Natural (not studio-perfect) lighting with uneven falloff
```

A prompt fragment combining all four:

```
"Shot on Kodak Portra 400, visible grain in shadows. Slightly off-center
framing with awkward crop at the left elbow. Skin shows visible pores,
natural redness around the nose, faint dark circles. Colors are muted and
warm, no artificial vibrancy. Subtle vignetting and soft focus falloff
toward frame edges. Light from a single window, uneven and directional,
casting imprecise shadows. Nothing about this image looks generated."
```

## Physical Medium Authenticity

AI image models default to clean, polished, digitally perfect output — even when asked for "hand-made" or "traditional" media. This section provides the vocabulary and prompt architecture to overcome that default for any physical medium.

### Why Prompts Fail at Authenticity

When you write `"linocut print with visible imperfections"` or `"oil painting with thick brushstrokes"`, the model interprets these as **stylistic flourishes** applied to an otherwise clean image. The result looks like a digital filter — clean underneath, with "imperfections" sprinkled on top.

To get genuine authenticity, you must:
1. Make the physical medium the **primary subject** of the prompt (more text, higher position)
2. Describe the **physical process** that creates each imperfection (causal, not decorative)
3. Explicitly **negate the clean default** the model wants to produce

### Prompt Architecture for Physical Media

Structure prompts for physical media in this order:

```
1. MEDIUM AND PROCESS (40% of prompt text weight)
   - What physical medium is this?
   - What tools and materials were used?
   - How does the physical process create imperfections?
   - What does the medium look like when done imperfectly by hand?

2. EXPLICIT NEGATIONS (10% of prompt text weight)
   - What should this NOT look like?
   - "NOT clean, NOT digital, NOT polished, NOT perfect"
   - Negate the specific clean defaults for this medium

3. COMPOSITION AND SUBJECT (30% of prompt text weight)
   - What is depicted in the image?
   - Composition, elements, arrangement

4. COLOR AND MOOD (10% of prompt text weight)
   - Color palette with restrictions
   - Emotional tone

5. NEGATIVE PROMPTS (10% of prompt text weight)
   - Technical exclusions
```

The key insight: **the medium description should outweigh the subject description**. If you write 3 sentences about the UFO and 1 sentence about the print texture, you'll get a clean digital UFO. If you write 1 sentence about the UFO and 3 sentences about ink transfer failures, you'll get an authentic print.

### Causal Language vs. Effect Language

**Effect language** (weak — model treats as filter):
```
"visible imperfections"
"hand-printed feel"
"slightly textured"
"with tool marks"
```

**Causal language** (strong — model simulates the physical process):
```
"ink fails to transfer in spots because hand-pressing pressure is uneven,
 leaving tiny white dots scattered across dark areas"

"the two color layers are not perfectly aligned because each was pressed
 separately by hand, so pink peeks out slightly offset from black edges"

"edges of the printed area are ragged and torn because the carved block
 is slightly smaller than the paper, leaving irregular ink marks at the margins"
```

The causal version tells the model **why** each imperfection exists, which produces more physically coherent results.

### ALL CAPS Emphasis

Use CAPITALIZED phrases for qualities the model consistently underweights:

```
"THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS IMAGE IS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE AN
 ACTUAL HAND-PULLED PRINT WITH HEAVY IMPERFECTIONS"

"ONLY faded dark gray and off-white cream — no true blacks, no pure whites"

"NOT clean, NOT digital, NOT polished"
```

Reserve caps for 2-3 critical qualities per prompt. Overuse dilutes the effect.

### Medium-Specific Imperfection Vocabularies

#### Relief Printing (Linocut / Woodcut)

```
Process imperfections:
- "white speckle and noise throughout dark areas where ink failed to transfer
   from block to paper — tiny white dots and patches from uneven pressure"
- "rough ragged block print edges — the border is NOT clean or geometric,
   it has torn irregular ink marks where the block met paper unevenly"
- "visible carved gouge marks from V-gouges and U-gouges — every surface
   shows the texture of carving tools used to remove linoleum"
- "uneven ink coverage — some areas heavily inked and dark, others thin
   and patchy from inconsistent hand-pressing pressure"
- "slight misregistration between color layers — the layers are not perfectly
   aligned because each was pressed separately by hand"
- "ink blobs and smudges in random areas from the hand-inking process"
- "grainy paper texture visible through thin ink areas"
- "the ink looks AGED AND IMPERFECT — not fresh crisp printing"

Negations:
"NOT clean edges, NOT digital, NOT polished, NOT crisp, NOT uniform ink"
```

#### Watercolor

```
Process imperfections:
- "pigment pools and blooms at edges where wet paint settled as paper dried"
- "visible paper texture (cold press) showing through thin wash areas"
- "uneven pigment density — darker granulation where paint pooled in paper valleys"
- "soft wet-on-wet bleeds where colors met while still damp"
- "tide marks and hard edges where paint dried before blending"
- "tiny spatter droplets from loading the brush"
- "paper buckled and slightly warped from water absorption"
- "pencil sketch lines still faintly visible beneath transparent washes"

Negations:
"NOT digital painting, NOT smooth gradients, NOT airbrush, NOT uniform color fills"
```

#### Oil Painting

```
Process imperfections:
- "visible brushstroke ridges — thick impasto where palette knife dragged through wet paint"
- "paint surface has physical texture with peaks and valleys catching light differently"
- "underlying canvas weave visible in thinly painted areas"
- "color mixing visible — not perfectly blended, adjacent strokes of different hues"
- "slight cracking in thick paint areas (craquelure)"
- "edges of forms show the direction and speed of the brush"
- "paint buildup at the edges of strokes where bristles deposited excess pigment"
- "fingerprint or rag wipe marks in blended areas"

Negations:
"NOT digital painting, NOT smooth blending, NOT perfect gradients, NOT photorealistic rendering"
```

#### Film Photography (Analog)

```
Process imperfections:
- "visible film grain — organic and irregular, not uniform digital noise,
   especially dense in shadow areas and midtones"
- "focus slightly missed — sharp on the ear but soft on the eyes,
   because the photographer shifted mid-click"
- "chromatic aberration at frame edges from imperfect lens optics"
- "faint light leak bleeding warm orange from the left edge where
   the camera back seal has degraded"
- "dust speck on the negative casting a tiny shadow on the print"
- "auto-white-balance slightly off, giving a warm color cast"
- "natural vignetting — corners darker from lens falloff"
- "slight motion blur on hands from a slow shutter speed"

Negations:
"NOT digitally perfect, NOT HDR, NOT artificially sharpened, NOT studio-lit"
```

#### Screenprint / Risograph

```
Process imperfections:
- "slight misregistration between color layers — colors offset by 1-2mm
   because each layer was printed in a separate pass"
- "visible halftone dot pattern in mid-tones"
- "ink saturation varies across the print — heavier at center, lighter at edges"
- "paper shows through in areas of thin ink coverage"
- "color mixing where overlapping ink layers create accidental third colors"
- "roller texture visible as faint horizontal banding"
- "small ink specks outside the image area from the printing process"

Negations:
"NOT clean digital print, NOT perfectly registered, NOT uniform ink density"
```

### Hybrid Prompt Pattern for JSON + Authenticity

When the user requests JSON format for a physical medium, use this hybrid structure:

```
[LEADING AUTHENTICITY BLOCK IN NATURAL LANGUAGE WITH CAPS EMPHASIS]

THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT: This must look like an actual [medium]
with real physical imperfections: [2-3 causal imperfection descriptions].
NOT clean, NOT digital, NOT polished.

[THEN THE JSON SCHEMA FOR COMPOSITION DETAILS]

{
  "subject_core": { ... },
  "environment_context": { ... },
  ...
}
```

This gives the model the authenticity weight through natural language while preserving the compositional precision of JSON.
